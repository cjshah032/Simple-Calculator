# Simple-Calculator
##### This is a simple calculator app made as a practice for the layout controls in UWP Development.

### Unhandled Exceptions in first draft: 
1. Case when no digit is specified after a decimal point

** Most exceptions handled in second draft. **



### Targets for next drafts:
- Handle all listed exceptions.
- Add an expandable split view, that contains buttons for brackets, root, and square.
- Stylise the buttons to impart better visual effects like color, fonts, etc.
- Customize the display option to make it more attractive and responsive to various inputs and errors.
