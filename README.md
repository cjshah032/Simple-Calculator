# Simple-Calculator
##### This is a simple calculator app made as a practice for the layout controls in UWP Development.

### Unhandled Exceptions in first draft: 
1. Case when two operators are used simultaneously (eg. 43//32)
2. Case when the input starts with an operator and not a number
3. Case when no digit is specified after a decimal point
4. (**Most important**) Handling operations linearly, starting from left moving towards right. The usual BODMAS convention is not implemented.


### Targets for next draft:
- Handle at least first three listed exceptions.
- Add an expandable split view, that contains buttons for brackets, root, and square.
- Stylise the buttons to impart better visual effects like color, fonts, etc.
- Customize the display option to make it more attractive and responsive to various inputs and errors.
